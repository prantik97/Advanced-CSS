1. Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css.

CSS Variables - The var() Function:

CSS variables are custom variables that we can create and reuse throughout our stylesheet.The var() function is 
used to insert the value of a CSS variable.
CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that we can create with local or global scope. 
A good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the 
same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.

Basic usage:

Cleaner stylesheets:  One of the major benefits of CSS variables is that it allows developers to consolidate 
their common properties into easy to reach locations, making code more readable and easier to maintain. Whilst this 
is a possibility in preprocessors, leveraging the technology in the browser itself gives access to more runtime 
information.

Easier theming:  One of the all-round favourite aspects of this technology is the ability to theme and skin 
components or entire pages with some planning and just a few lines of additional CSS.

Read and write pivotal style properties with JS:  With more and more frontend development taking the 
form of Javascript dominant frameworks and integrations, the need to seamlessly communicate between form 
and function is more critical than ever. Thankfully the values of CSS variables are easily read and written by 
Javascript adding even more levels of runtime flexibility to an already versatile feature.
